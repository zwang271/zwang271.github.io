I am a second year Computer Science PhD student at Iowa State University, working with [Kristin Yvonne Rozier](https://www.aere.iastate.edu/kyrozier/) in the [Laboratory for Temporal Logic](https://laboratory.temporallogic.org/).
I hold a double major B.A. in Computer Science and Mathematics from UC Berkeley.

My research interests lie at the intersection of formal methods and artificial intelligence. I focus on developing tools and algorithms for temporal logic and formally verifying these algorithms using interactive theorem provers, primarily Isabelle/HOL. Additionally, I am interested in applying reinforcement learning to automated theorem proving.
